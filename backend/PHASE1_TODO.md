# Backend Refactoring Phase 1: TODO List

## ðŸŽ‰ STATUS: COMPLETED âœ… (2025-09-10)

**All route extractions successfully completed!** The monolithic 2,882-line `index.js` has been split into 9 modular route files with comprehensive documentation and zero downtime migration.

**Final Results:**
- âœ… **54 endpoints** extracted across **9 route modules**
- âœ… **1 middleware module** (auth) extracted
- âœ… **Server running successfully** at https://localhost:4443
- âœ… **Zero breaking changes** to existing API contracts
- âœ… **All original code preserved** (commented, not deleted) for rollback safety

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of splitting the monolithic `index.js` (2,882 lines) into modular components.

## Approach
1. Create new file with extracted functionality
2. Comment out (don't delete) old code in index.js
3. Update all references to use new module
4. Test thoroughly before proceeding
5. Commit after each successful extraction
