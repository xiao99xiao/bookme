# ðŸŽ¯ Frontend Blockchain UX Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement seamless blockchain payment integration with clear user flows for booking creation, payment, cancellation, and completion.

## Core UX Flows

### 1. Create Booking Flow (/:username page)
**Steps:**
1. User clicks "Book Now" button
2. Call backend API `POST /api/bookings` to create booking
3. Backend responds with booking data + blockchain authorization
4. Frontend prompts user to commit blockchain transaction
5. Show "Processing..." status while waiting for confirmation
6. Backend monitors blockchain events and updates booking status
7. **Timeout Handling**: If no transaction within 3 minutes, booking remains in "pending_payment" status

**UI Components Needed:**
- Enhanced BookingModal with blockchain transaction handling
- TransactionStatusModal for showing progress
- Error handling for transaction failures

### 2. Payment Flow (My Bookings page)
**For bookings with status "pending_payment":**
1. Show "Pay Now" button instead of regular booking actions
2. Click "Pay Now" â†’ Request payment authorization from backend
3. Prompt user to commit payment transaction
4. Monitor transaction status and update UI
5. Success â†’ booking status becomes "paid"

**UI Components Needed:**
- PaymentButton component
- Transaction monitoring integration

### 3. Cancel Flow
**Steps:**
1. User clicks "Cancel Booking" button
2. Call backend API `POST /api/bookings/:id/initiate-cancel`
3. Backend sets status to "pending_cancellation" 
4. Frontend prompts user to commit cancel transaction
5. Monitor blockchain events for cancellation confirmation
6. Success â†’ booking status becomes "cancelled"

**UI Components Needed:**
- CancelBookingButton with blockchain integration
- Cancellation confirmation modal

### 4. Complete Service Flow
**Steps:**
1. Provider clicks "Mark Complete" button  
2. Call backend API `POST /api/bookings/:id/initiate-complete`
3. Backend sets status to "pending_completion"
4. Frontend prompts user to commit completion transaction
5. Monitor blockchain events for completion confirmation
6. Success â†’ booking status becomes "completed", funds distributed

**UI Components Needed:**
- CompleteServiceButton with blockchain integration
- Service completion confirmation modal

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Create blockchain service client (`src/lib/blockchain-service.ts`)
- [ ] Create transaction status monitoring hooks
- [ ] Create reusable transaction modal components
- [ ] Add blockchain error handling utilities

### Phase 2: Booking Creation (/:username page)
- [ ] Update BookingModal with blockchain integration
- [ ] Add transaction prompting after booking creation
- [ ] Implement transaction status monitoring
- [ ] Handle 3-minute timeout scenarios

### Phase 3: My Bookings Page Enhancement
- [ ] Update CustomerBookings page with payment buttons
- [ ] Add PaymentButton component for pending payments
- [ ] Integrate transaction monitoring for payment flow
- [ ] Update booking status display with blockchain states

### Phase 4: Provider Actions
- [ ] Add CompleteServiceButton to provider order management
- [ ] Implement service completion blockchain flow
- [ ] Add provider-side transaction monitoring

### Phase 5: Cancellation System
- [ ] Add CancelBookingButton to both customer and provider views
- [ ] Implement cancellation blockchain flow
- [ ] Handle cancellation transaction monitoring

### Phase 6: Real-time Updates & Polish
- [ ] Implement WebSocket or polling for real-time status updates
- [ ] Add loading states and error recovery
- [ ] Test timeout scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Add transaction history viewing

## Technical Requirements

### Environment Variables (Frontend)
```bash
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x1D59b8DD5b1f6bE31C48a7AB82eaA322752880C7
VITE_USDC_ADDRESS=0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e
VITE_CHAIN_ID=84532
VITE_BLOCKCHAIN_EXPLORER=https://sepolia.basescan.org
```

### Dependencies
```bash
npm install ethers@6
```

### Key Components Architecture

1. **BlockchainService** (`src/lib/blockchain-service.ts`)
   - Contract interaction wrapper
   - Transaction execution
   - Balance checking
   - Error handling

2. **Transaction Hooks** (`src/hooks/useTransaction.ts`)
   - Transaction status monitoring
   - Real-time updates
   - Error state management

3. **Transaction Modal** (`src/components/TransactionModal.tsx`)
   - Reusable transaction prompting
   - Progress indication
   - Error display

4. **Enhanced Booking Components**
   - BookingModal with blockchain integration
   - PaymentButton for pending payments
   - CancelBookingButton with blockchain
   - CompleteServiceButton with blockchain

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can create bookings and complete blockchain payment in one flow
- [ ] Pending payments show "Pay Now" button after 3-minute timeout
- [ ] All blockchain actions (pay, cancel, complete) work seamlessly
- [ ] Real-time status updates reflect blockchain events
- [ ] Error handling provides clear user feedback
- [ ] Transaction history is visible and trackable

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create booking â†’ immediate payment flow
- [ ] Create booking â†’ timeout â†’ pay later flow
- [ ] Payment retry scenarios
- [ ] Cancellation by both customer and provider
- [ ] Service completion by customer
- [ ] Network error handling
- [ ] Insufficient balance scenarios
- [ ] Transaction rejection handling
