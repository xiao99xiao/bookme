## üîß Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Set environment variables in .env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_deployer_private_key
BACKEND_SIGNER=backend_signer_address
PLATFORM_FEE_WALLET=platform_fee_wallet_address
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key

# 2. Get Etherscan API key from https://etherscan.io/apis or https://basescan.org/apis
# 3. Verify you have sufficient ETH for deployment
# Estimated cost: ~0.05 ETH on Base at 20 gwei
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Base Sepolia Testnet
```bash
# 1. Deploy contract
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol \
    --rpc-url base_sepolia \
    --broadcast \
    --verify \
    -vvvv

# 2. Save deployment address from output
# Example: BookingEscrow deployed at: 0x...
```

### Step 3: Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# 1. Verify contract on BaseScan (if not auto-verified)
forge verify-contract \
    --chain base_sepolia \
    --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor(address,address,address)" \
        0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e \
        $BACKEND_SIGNER \
        $PLATFORM_FEE_WALLET) \
    CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
    src/BookingEscrow.sol:BookingEscrow

# 2. Verify contract state
cast call CONTRACT_ADDRESS "owner()" --rpc-url base_sepolia
cast call CONTRACT_ADDRESS "backendSigner()" --rpc-url base_sepolia
cast call CONTRACT_ADDRESS "platformFeeWallet()" --rpc-url base_sepolia
cast call CONTRACT_ADDRESS "paused()" --rpc-url base_sepolia
```

### Step 4: Integration Testing
```bash
# 1. Create test booking (requires backend signature)
# 2. Complete test service
# 3. Test cancellation flow
# 4. Verify fund distributions
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Before Mainnet Deployment

1. **MUST FIX: Emergency Cancellation Vulnerability**
   - Implement timelock (24-48 hours)
   - Consider multi-sig requirement
   - Add rate limiting

2. **SHOULD FIX: Precision Handling**
   - Add minimum booking amount (e.g., 10 USDC)
   - Handle dust amounts properly

3. **Backend Integration**
   - Ensure backend signer is secure
   - Implement proper nonce management
   - Set up monitoring and alerts

### Security Best Practices

1. **Key Management**
   - Use hardware wallet for deployment
   - Secure backend signer private key
   - Rotate keys regularly

2. **Monitoring**
   - Set up event monitoring
   - Track gas prices
   - Monitor for unusual activity

3. **Emergency Response**
   - Have pause mechanism ready
   - Document emergency procedures
   - Test recovery scenarios

## üìä Deployment Validation Tests

Run these tests after deployment:

### 1. Contract State Verification
```javascript
// Verify all critical parameters
assert(owner == expected_owner)
assert(backendSigner == expected_signer)
assert(platformFeeWallet == expected_wallet)
assert(USDC == correct_usdc_address)
assert(!paused)
```

### 2. Functionality Tests
- [ ] Create booking with valid signature
- [ ] Complete service successfully
- [ ] Cancel booking as customer
- [ ] Cancel booking as provider
- [ ] Emergency cancel (backend only)

### 3. Access Control Tests
- [ ] Owner functions restricted
- [ ] Backend functions restricted
- [ ] Customer/provider functions work

### 4. Fee Calculation Tests
- [ ] Platform fees calculate correctly
- [ ] Inviter fees (when applicable)
- [ ] Provider receives correct amount
